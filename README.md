# ImageMosaicBuilder
This script performs feature-based image matching, geometric relationship estimation, and image mosaic generation between pairs of images in a given directory. It uses OpenCV (cv2) to detect features, compute fundamental and homography matrices, and blend overlapping images into a seamless mosaic.
